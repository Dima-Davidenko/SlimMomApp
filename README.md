## Project description

This is an educational project, the main goal of which is to learn how to work with React, Redux, RTK, RTK Query, TypeScript, REST API, Material UI, localization (i18n), color scheme switching using css variables. All the necessary information for the application to work correctly comes from a remote server, which I cannot change, so I cannot localize some data (information about products) and therefore the application is not very useful for real use. But it was really helpful to practice with all the mentioned technologies.
